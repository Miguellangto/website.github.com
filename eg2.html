              <strong>What types of broadcasting software can we use for our stream? (Miguel)</strong><br>
              For our research (The Ideal Choice of Public Transportation for APEC Marikina Students), we can use OBS Studio for online streaming. While apps like Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram provide basic live streaming options using a device’s camera and mic, OBS Studio allows advanced editing and live-streaming features. For mobile or tablet streaming, we can use Streamlabs. Conclusion: Facebook will be our platform, with OBS Studio as the software app.

              <p>Although the tools of mind mapping, 5 whys, and fishbone diagram all lead to a conclusion to a problem, the main differences lie in their structure. Mind maps are more versatile and can have abundant connections, while fishbone diagrams are more organized and specific with the order of the problems, and 5 whys is the most efficient as most problems done with this method usually have the root identified at the 5th or 7th question.

              <strong>What helped you choose and decide on a color palette? (Earl)</strong><br>
              Our color scheme was heavily influenced by our content, which revolves around public transportation. Since public transportation often includes bright colors, we wanted to include this style in our stream design.

              <strong>What are the factors you consider when choosing and deciding on a theme? (Sofia)</strong><br>
              The factors I consider are closely related to our topic of public transportation, which plays a vital role in the daily lives of many Filipinos. As you can see in the lower part of the template, the building symbolizes urban development and the importance of accessible transport systems in connecting people to essential services. Meanwhile, the presence of jeepneys, a popular mode of public transport in the Philippines, signifies the rich cultural heritage and the unique challenges faced by commuters.

          2. Determine:
        </p>
        
        <h6><strong>Situation 1 (Sofia):</strong></h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What was violated:</strong> Joelle’s private information</li>
          <li><strong>Why it was violated:</strong> Since she answered a survey by a survey company which she was randomly selected</li>
          <li><strong>What the victim should know:</strong> The victim shouldn’t trust the company that easily, especially if she was just randomly selected. It is important to do research about the company before entrusting personal information to them and to not jump to conclusions since it could be spam.</li>
          <li><strong>The punishment to be given to the violator:</strong> If it's determined that the company purposely or recklessly shared her information, the organization could face financial penalties or fines, depending on the crime committed. The company's reputation is also damaged, affecting customer trust.</li>
        </ul>
     
        <h6><strong>Situation 2 (Apple & Raibert):</strong></h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What was violated (Apple):</strong> Drew’s personal identity</li>
          <li><strong>Why it was violated (Apple):</strong> He posted her driver's license, and someone used it as proof of identification to scam buyers.</li>
          <li><strong>What the victim should know (Raibert):</strong> Personal information, especially government credentials like a driver's license, should be kept private. This information can harm the victim by enabling identity fraud and malicious actions. In Drew's case, his information was used to create a fake virtual store for scamming victims.</li>
          <li><strong>The punishment to be given to the violator (Raibert):</strong> The violator could face imprisonment and fines ranging from Php500,000 to Php2,000,000 for unauthorized processing and breach of sensitive data. Penalties include:
            <ul>
              <li>Unauthorized processing of personal sensitive information: 3-6 years imprisonment and fines of Php500,000 to Php4,000,000.</li>

          </li>
        </ul>
     
        <h6><strong>Situation 3 (Earl & Nina):</strong></h6>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What was violated:</strong> Ivanne’s rights to her identity.</li>
          <li><strong>Why it was violated:</strong> The violation occurred when her stream was recorded and posted on another social media platform without her consent.</li>
          <li><strong>What the victim should know:</strong> The victim should be aware of their rights and know that it’s important to talk to someone about their experience if they feel their rights are being violated.</li>
          <li><strong>The punishment to be given to the violator:</strong> Depending on state laws, penalties for cyberbullying can range from school suspension to jail time. Unauthorized sharing of personal information can lead to imprisonment (3-6 years) and fines (Php500,000 to Php4,000,000).</li>

            <strong>Why is consent important and highlighted in the Data Privacy Act? (Earl)</strong><br>
            Consent is important because it ensures that the right to privacy is not violated and helps establish boundaries for data usage.

            <strong>Explain the provisions of the Philippines’ Data Privacy Act. (Raibert)</strong><br>
            The provisions of the Philippine Data Privacy act ensures the regulations and guidelines of individuals possessing, processing, collection, and privacy of personal data. The act implements security measures to protect the confidentiality, security of personal information for lawful purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How would the Data Privacy Act affect streaming? (Sofia)</strong><br>
            The Data Privacy Act is crucial for streaming services because it helps protect users' personal information. These laws set rules on how companies can collect and use data, ensuring that consumers are aware of what happens to their information. Data privacy acts make sure these companies are clear about what data they collect, how they use it, and who else might see it. This transparency is crucial because it helps build trust between consumers and streaming services. These laws also enforce penalties for companies that break the rules, motivating them to take data protection seriously. This not only keeps user information secure but also encourages services to develop features that prioritize user privacy.

        <li><strong>Is your outline inspired by other streamers? Who are they? (Raibert)</strong><br>
          Yes, our stream is inspired by various streamers. Our Stream countdown and Q&A were inspired by my friend Jacob from APEC Ortex, who had their IPBA stream earlier, and I just so happened to stroll by their stream.

        <li><strong>How will you promote your stream? (Sofia)</strong><br>
          By sharing our poster through our social media, such as Instagram or Facebook. Furthermore, we plan to create a FB Page where we can inform our viewers about the context of our stream and much more.

        <li><strong>What are your main ways to promote? (Sofia)</strong><br>
          As mentioned above, through the use of social media and by creating a FB Page.
        </li>
        <li><strong>How will you make sure that your plan to promote your stream is effective? (Earl)</strong><br>
          We must first ensure that the stream reaches our target audience through our social media accounts before the stream date to ensure effective promotion. Furthermore, we must ensure that our streams are easily available and that our content goes beyond just streaming.
        </li>
        <li><strong>How do you plan to promote your stream to your target viewers? (Nina)</strong><br>

          It helps by giving every member a guide on how the stream should flow. Each step in the outline serves as the basis for what will happen during the stream. It is essential because it is the foundation for whether your stream will be entertaining and interactive with its audience.

      <li><strong>How was your experience in creating a web design? (Nina)</strong><br>
        It was a mixed experience. The brainstorming of ideas and designs feels great, but in terms of regulations, we have to be mindful and considerate to our team's coder.
      </li>
      <li><strong>What are the challenges you encountered? What are the steps you took to overcome them? (Sofia)</strong><br>
        When creating a web design, we encountered various challenges. This includes choosing the right color scheme that we would apply to our website, which is related to our topic. Moreover, finding the layout of the website was one of the challenges we faced. We plan to make the website look neat and organized to catch the interest of the audience. But we were able to solve this problem through the use of online websites that guide us in finding the right layout and color scheme.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Which of the design elements do you think is your strength? Why? (Earl)</strong><br>
        I believe that our usage of complex color schemes and graphics from public transportation are our strongest design features. These elements communicate and introduce our topic effectively because our target audience will already have an idea of what our topic will be about.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Which of the elements is your weakness? Why? (Raibert)</strong><br>
        I would say the F and Z patterns as they required us to restructure our website to fit the format in which the viewers would lay their eyes upon. Lastly, the color scheme was also a weakness as it is dependent on other factors, such as our stream.

        Failing to document your plan may result in chaos and a lack of clarity. This can hinder your ability to monitor your progress, assess your effectiveness, and make well-informed decisions regarding your upcoming streaming pursuits.
      </li>
      <li><strong>How important is documentation in streaming? (Nina)</strong><br>
        By documenting your streaming progress, you can elevate your content, build a stronger community, and enhance your overall streaming experience. The information gathered from documentation helps you stay focused and organized during your stream.
