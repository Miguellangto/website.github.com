After doing an activity on what makes a stream good, check your knowledge by answering the questions below:
</strong>
<br>
<strong>
What are the characteristics of a good stream and how will you apply these when you were the one to create a stream?
</strong>
<br>
<br>
What makes a stream good is how eye-catching the theme or subject itself draws in the viewers, and those people stay and become more loyal to the streamer due to the individuals and streamer themselves as they captivate them through their entertaining strategies that hook viewers to stay and find out until the end.  We can apply this by researching the algorithm and thumbnail trends (This is usually to target a younger audience) so that we can apply the hook to our content, and depending on the type of stream we can rearrange our layout to a more relaxed visual by using warm colors and friendly backgrounds and music. Unfortunately, not all people are entertaining personality-wise however with the use of editing we can apply certain transition strategies, VFX, images, and memes to incorporate a more polished and entertaining video.

        <li>
            <strong>In a community or situation, it is impossible to have only one problem. How would you know what problem needs to be dealt with first?</strong>
            <p>We would know what problem needs to be dealt with first if it made a negative impact in the community. - Sofia</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How would you explain the importance of brainstorming ideas with other people to find a solution to a problem?</strong>
            <p>It is important for the ideate phase, as brainstorming sparks creativity and critical thinking to improve the solution.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How would you use the resources available to solve a problem?</strong>
            <p>By using affordable resources and ensuring that every resource counts toward the prototype, you can ensure the effectiveness of the outcome of the solution. - Earl</p>

      <p><strong> HOW DO I KNOW WHAT CONTENT TO CREATE FOR STREAMING?</strong><br>
        Imagine that you are a streamer. You have a lot of followers and 
        subscribers who depend on your content for entertainment and information. As an APEC Schools student, you wanted to use this opportunity and avenue to provide help to your viewers. Using the Design Thinking Process, what type of content are you going to create that will be helpful in the situation we are in right now? 
        
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGPr3TnPSo/j1wrQxRWXNzM9KJndmRW7Q/edit?utm_content=DAGPr3TnPSo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton">Link to Canva</a>
<br> 

  <p>
      <strong>Empathize</strong><br>
      We are trying to help our viewers by using our streaming platform as a way for them to be informed of the current typhoons. In case of emergencies, our viewers need to know the evacuation points, supplies and food they need, news about the weather pattern, and incoming rescuers. We want to help and assure them from their worries and anxiety as any person facing catastrophe would be in dire need of help.
  </p>

  <p>
      <strong>Define</strong><br>
      Our problem that we need to solve is the lack of information that may endanger someone because of it. We plan to inform our viewers as a way to help the community. The information we need to carry it out will consist of <strong>current whereabouts of the typhoon</strong>, <strong>evacuation areas</strong>, <strong>lifelines/emergency hotlines</strong>, and <strong>nearby rescue operations</strong>. This is all capable because of the news station and Government announcements that we relay; otherwise, we are not able to help or volunteer as the safety of oneself is top priority.
  </p>

  <p>
      <strong>Ideate</strong><br>
      Aside from the information we relay, we can also do a <strong>charity run</strong> in our stream in which we would use the donated money to fund and supply the community with emergency kits. The remaining money will then be donated to charity organizations and safe havens to strengthen the resistance against and during a typhoon.
  </p>

  <p>
      <strong>Prototype</strong><br>
      Our stream layout will heavily take on the format of news channels, mainly the <strong>Ted Failon show</strong> if anyone is familiar—they broadcast and talk about certain problems and news in society. The main difference from us is that we will be exposing this info to social media where it is more accessible to the population than being limited to a TV channel. Our stream will be held for a long period, as trends also show that long livestream hours give viewers time to come in and catch up. As we finish announcing and post information, we will leave the stream running unattended with a repeating group of text including <strong>hotlines</strong> and <strong>current events</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
      <strong>Test</strong><br>
      The biggest weakness in our plan is that it's locked behind the internet and a device. The current typhoon may also affect the signal and clarity of the stream and hinder our efforts. Our strengths with this plan would definitely be the awareness we spread, as other areas in the country can participate in our cause by donating and sharing through family members.

    WHAT ARE JAVASCRIPT OPERATORS?
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Use the methods of Basic Research to perform research on how these operators are used in Javascript. After that, create a detailed guide on how they are used. When creating a guide, think as if you are creating a guide for a 5-year-old. In that case, you will be able to create a guide that is understandable by any type of audience.</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      A javascript operator uses symbols and signs that communicate with other code/scripts to perform functions. There are three types of operators, let's start with one of the most basic ones to further our understanding. Arithmetic operators use the signs in Math to be used for numbers in the code, it includes the 4 common operations of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division or expressed as + - * /. It also includes an extra 4 more operations which are Exponents, Remainder, Increment, and Decrement expressed by these symbols **, %, ++, --.
      <br><br>
      The next type of operator is a Logical operator they are used to tell the script if they should combine, find an alternative, or stop from combining. They are expressed in symbols of &&, ||, and the exclamation mark (!).
      <br><br>
      Lastly are Assignment operators, from the name they assign, subtract, divide, and multiply values. Arithmetic operators are for numbers within a code but variables are information stored within, and with that information, we can assign them values that can be changed. There are 6 operators in the Assignment and they are: = (Assigns a value to a variable), += (adds a value to the variable), -= (subtracts a value from the variable), *= (multiplies the variable), /= (divides a variable), and %= (Assigns a remainder to the variable).

        Live streaming is all about media that is produced in real time where viewers can interact with the content creator in real time.
      </li>
      <li><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of streaming?</strong>
        <br>
        Audience engagement, no commercials, instant access, and a large variety of content. Limited time, need for internet access, difficult to keep viewers engaged, and no do-overs.
      </li>
      <li><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of live streaming?</strong>
        <br>
        The advantages are you can interact with people online in real time, if you are a live seller you can show off the product to the buyers giving you more chances of selling the product, and many more. It is still very prone to accidents that are not allowed or safe to show to the viewers. (Talha)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Have you ever tried doing a live stream? Describe your experience.</strong>
        <br>
        Yes, when I first started doing live streaming it feels awkward since I am not used to interacting with other people especially in real-time event. However, I got used to it as soon as I feel comfortable with interacting with my audiences especially if it’s my friends. Sofia
      </li>
      <li><strong>What are the phases of the Design Thinking Process? Describe each phase.</strong>
        <br>
        - Empathize
        <br>
        It is a skill that allows us to understand and share the same feelings that others feel. Through this empathy, we are able to put ourselves in other people’s shoes and connect with how they might be feeling about their problem, circumstance, or situation.
        <br>
        - Define
        <br>
        This step identifies the problem we are trying to solve. This helps us to be oriented to the same solution.
        <br>
        - Ideate
        <br>
        Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas and solutions through a group discussion like sketching, prototyping, brainstorming, and more.
        <br>
        - Prototype
        <br>
        This is when the group creates a tangible representation of an idea or solution that they can test.
        <br>
        - Test
        <br>
        This step completes the whole experiment. It helps the product, design, and development team evaluate their concepts and prototypes for a solution. (Talha)
      </li>
      <li><strong>What is Javascript?</strong>
        <br>
        Javascript is a form of coding language that supports websites making static websites into websites with energy, life, animation, and working functions. (Talha)
      </li>
      <li><strong>What makes Javascript unique?</strong>
        <br>
        Javascript serves as the nervous system/organ of a website which makes this coding language unique. (Talha)
      </li>
      <li><strong>What are the uses of Javascript?</strong>
        <br>
        Interactive UX, Innovations, plug-ins, updates, and patches. App, game, A.I, and website developments. (Talha)

      <li><strong>Based on your research, what do you think is the best platform to use for streaming? Explain your answer.</strong>
        <p>For me, YouTube is the best platform to use for streaming. YouTube has a strong search recommendation and navigation to help viewers find their interests; this is also beneficial for content creators, especially for growing accounts. It doesn't solely focus on gaming; it supports a variety of content, but what gets well-known is still based on audience interest. The content creator can attract more viewers by creating an eye-catching thumbnail. YouTube doesn't require much material when streaming; you just need a device and a reliable Wi-Fi connection to be able to stream and upload to your account.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>Why do you think the web interface of a streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>For a better experience for the users, they can navigate the videos they want to watch easily and keep the user engaged through the accessibility and features of the streaming platform.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Why do you think the mobile compatibility of a streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>To allow users to easily access the streaming platform without encountering any slowness, crashes, or other issues that could harm their device. In particular, the majority of users use mobile devices. A large audience may be drawn to experience the improved version of the platform if it is easy to use, particularly for mobile users.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Why do you think the accessibility of the streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>Because it can be advantageous to both parties, an accessible streaming platform is easy to use, provides high-quality audio and real-time captioning, and can help make live-stream content accessible. On the other hand, if the streaming platform's accessibility continues to improve, it has the potential to draw in a large audience.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Why do you think the navigation of a streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>To make it easier for users to navigate the content they want to watch without experiencing struggles. Better navigation makes it easy for users to browse varied information and discover their interests.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Why do you think the fast load times of a streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>Slow loading times usually irritate most users. Thus, if the platform with fast load times guarantees an enjoyable experience and receives positive feedback from users, it may draw in more users.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Why do you think the video quality of a streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>Users typically judge based on the quality of the video. A poor-quality video frequently loses the interest of the user; on the other hand, a high-quality video draws in more viewers. So, the better the quality, the larger the audience you can attract.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>Why do you think the sound quality of a streaming platform is important?</strong>
        <p>Similar to video quality, audio quality also affects audience engagement; the higher the quality, the larger the audience. The most important aspect of streaming is audio quality because it allows you to interact with and keep the interest of your audience. Additionally, it improves the listening experience and prevents misconceptions.</p>

      </li>
    
      <li><strong>How do the Javascript Operators differ from one another?</strong>
        <p>The main difference between the two operators is how they compare values. The == operator compares the values of two variables after performing type conversion if necessary. On the other hand, the === operator compares the values of two variables without performing type conversion.</p>

      <li><strong>1. What are the most commonly used streaming platforms?</strong>
        <p>The most popular streaming platforms are YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch. These are frequently used since they all have one thing in common: streaming media, which is one of today's current ways to share content online. - (Earl)</p>
      </li>
    
      <li><strong>2. How do they differ from each other?</strong>
        <p>Facebook focuses on increased interactivity with other users, and while streaming media is one of its features, it is primarily a social networking website. YouTube, on the other hand, focuses on streaming various types of content through videos and enables user engagement while streaming. Twitch is comparable to YouTube, except it is primarily geared toward live streaming content creators rather than pre-recorded videos. Twitch is a better option for engagement because it is created in real-time. - (Earl)</p>

            <strong>What is the difference between Comparison and Logical Operators?</strong> 
            <br>
            Comparison Operators are used to compare and contrast values, often resulting in true or false. Logical operators combine variables and values, and are used to group different expressions. The `||` operator, for instance, helps when one condition isn't met.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Give comparisons where the result is true:</strong> 
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>x > 9 - true</li>
              <li>x != 16 - true</li>
              <li>x == 10 - true</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Give comparisons where the result is false:</strong> 
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>x === "10" - false</li>
              <li>x < 1 - false</li>
              <li>x >= 100 - false</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Consider the following expressions and explain the results:</strong> 
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>(x > 7 || y !== 5) is true - Explanation: The expression is false because the OR operator evaluates whether either condition is true. Since y equals 5, the second part is false.</li>
              <li>(x == 8 && y > 6) is false - Explanation: The AND operator requires both conditions to be true, but while x equals 8, y is not greater than 6, making the entire expression false.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            <strong>What type of information is needed to analyze viewers of each content type?</strong>
            <br>
            It's ideal to gather demographic data like age, gender, and education level to analyze viewers and tailor content to their preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why is it important to analyze the profile of viewers?</strong>
            <br>

              <strong> 1. What type of information do you need in order to analyze viewers of each content type?</strong>
              <br>
              To be able to analyze the viewers in each content type, it is ideal to determine the demographic data of each content type's viewers, including their age, gender, level of education, and many other details. This enables us to gather little but crucial data that would help us optimize our content to our target audience's preferences and make it engaging to watch.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Why is it important to analyze the profile of viewers of different content types?</strong>
              <br>
              Analyzing is the process of evaluating the audience to obtain information to make changes to the material that will meet our target audience's preferences. This enables us to interact with them, entertain them, and obtain a deeper understanding. Furthermore, understanding your audience's preferences can help you make wise decisions and deliver your information better.

          <p>
            <strong>When are expressions considered true?</strong>
            <br>
            When any logical operator operates on non-zero values, the expression is true.

<p><strong>After doing an activity on what makes a stream good, check your knowledge by answering the questions below:</strong></p>
<br>

 <P><strong>What are the characteristics of a good stream and how will you apply these when you were the one to create a stream?</strong></P>
 <br>
<p>Answer: 
  What makes a stream good is how eye-catching the theme or subject itself draws in the viewers, and those people stay and become more loyal to the streamer due to the individuals and streamer themselves as they captivate them through their entertaining strategies that hook viewers to stay and find out until the end.  We can apply this by researching the algorithm and thumbnail trends (This is usually to target a younger audience) so that we can apply the hook to our content, and depending on the type of stream we can rearrange our layout to a more relaxed visual by using warm colors and friendly backgrounds and music. Unfortunately, not all people are entertaining personality-wise however with the use of editing we can apply certain transition strategies, VFX, images, and memes to incorporate a more polished and entertaining video.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A switch statement is a control statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case.</li>
              <li><strong>Syntax:</strong>
                <pre>
                  switch (expression) {
                    case value1:
                      // code block
                      break;
                    case value2:
                      // code block
                      break;
                    default:
                      // code block
                  }
                </pre>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Usage:</strong> A switch statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable, providing a cleaner alternative to multiple if-else statements.</li>

              <strong>What is a switch statement?</strong>
              <br>
              A switch statement is a control structure that allows you to execute different code blocks based on the value of a variable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>When is a switch statement used?</strong>
              <br>
              A switch statement is used when you have a variable that can have multiple values, and you want to execute different code for each value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What is a break keyword and what does this do?</strong>
              <br>
              The break keyword is used to terminate a switch statement or a loop, preventing the execution of subsequent cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What is a default keyword and what does this do?</strong>
              <br>
              The default keyword specifies the code to run if none of the cases match the value of the switch expression.
